# WeebIRC

WeebIRC is a simple and small IRC client heavily focussed on anime watchers which use XDCC (DCC) to get their anime.
It's main features are:

  - Search directly on nibl.co.uk within the application
  - Start download by selecting/clicking on a search result
  - Batch download by downloading your selection/ search result one by one(no ques).
  - Stream/Watch your anime while it is downloading (by double clicking on the item in the downloadlist)


### Version
0.0.1

### Installation

This application works as a stand-alone application. It does require acces to your folder system. On launch it wants to create it's own download directory in your "C:\Users\\*Your Username\*\Downloads" directory. If the program is not able to find this directory it will prompt you to select your own specified download folder on where he can put his files. In this folder a map will be created by the name WeebIRC, this map also contains a Settings map containing ah Settings.conf. **Do not change this file if you do not know what you are doing!**

### Development
You can do with it whatever you want :D. I will be updating this application and add more features when I find the time for it.

### Todos

- Redo chat output, its now raw text from the irc on certain channels.
- **A bot that goes by the name "CS|Tori" is currently not working!** - fixing that soon(hopefully)
- Gui improvements along the way.

### Disclaimer
This application is still in alpha stadium, many things might go wrong and therefore I am not 
responsible for whatever happens while you use this application.

Things that might happen:

- Due to an something bla bla it keeps spamming the bot with xdcc send messages (once every 2 seconds) which could result in a (temporary) ban
- Downloading anime is at your own risk :X.
- Due to your computer being a cardbox it might catch fire and burn your whole place down
- Due to you not paying attention you might suddenly download a virus... shit happens.
- Due to you being at the wrong place, at the wrong time, you might die...
